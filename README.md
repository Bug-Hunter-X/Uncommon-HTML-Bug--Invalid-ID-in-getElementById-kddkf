This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML related to using `getElementById`. The bug arises from a discrepancy between the actual ID in the HTML and the ID used in the JavaScript `getElementById` function. IDs in HTML are case-sensitive and can't contain spaces or certain special characters, which is not always intuitively obvious to developers.  The solution showcases how to resolve this issue by correcting the ID to match the case and characters used in the `getElementById` call.
